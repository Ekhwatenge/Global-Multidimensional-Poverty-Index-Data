# Global-Multidimensional-Poverty-Index-Data
This repository contains data on the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) for various countries and regions around the world.
# Dataset Description
The dataset provides information on multidimensional poverty indicators including:
# MPI score
* Headcount ratio (percentage of poor people)
* Intensity of deprivation
* Percentage vulnerable to poverty
# Percentage of severe poverty
Data is available for multiple countries, with subnational breakdowns for many. The period covered varies by country but generally ranges from the early 2000s to early 2020s.
# Data Format
The data is provided in CSV format with the following columns:
location_code: Country or region code
1. has_hrp: Whether the location has a Humanitarian Response Plan
2. in_gho: Whether the location is included in the Global Humanitarian Overview
3. provider_admin1_name: Name of first administrative level (e.g. state/province)
4. admin1_code: Code for first administrative level
5. admin1_name: Name of first administrative level
6. mpi: Multidimensional Poverty Index score
7. headcount_ratio: Percentage of population that is multidimensionally poor
8. intensity_of_deprivation: Average deprivation score of poor people
9. vulnerable_to_poverty: Percentage of population vulnerable to poverty
10. in_severe_poverty: Percentage of population in severe poverty
11. reference_period_start: Start of reference period for data
12. reference_period_end: End of reference period for data
# Usage
This data can be used to analyze multidimensional poverty trends across countries and regions over time. Potential use cases include:
* Comparing poverty levels between countries and subnational regions
* Tracking changes in poverty indicators over time
* Identifying areas with high levels of severe poverty
* Analyzing the relationship between different poverty measures
# Data Source
This dataset is compiled from national surveys and published by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
